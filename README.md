# Deep Fingerprinting
:warning: experimental - PLEASE BE CAREFUL. Intended for reasearch purposes only.

The source code and dataset are used to demonstrate the DF model, and reproduce the results of the ACM CCS2018 paper:

## Dataset
We published the datasets of web traffic traces produced for the closed-world evaluations on non-defended and WTF-PAD datasets. However, due to the limitation on the size of uploaded files on Github, we uploaded our dataset to google drive repository instead. 

They can be downloaded in links below.

The datasets for the open world and source code will be also available soon.


### Dataset used for non-defended dataset in the closed-world scenario
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sFjUqo3r4E0KZsTWF0f-3zfLM5FfRot9

The dataset including 6 files 

X_train_NoDef.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the training data)

y_train_NoDef.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the training data)

X_valid_NoDef.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the validation data)

y_valid_NoDef.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the validation data)

X_test_NoDef.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the testing data)

y_test_NoDef.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the testing data)

Before training and evaluating DF model please place these files into ../df/dataset/NoDef/

### Dataset used for defended dataset(WTF-PAD) in the closed-world scenario
https://drive.google.com/open?id=187JjQ-Dz4g4zMBkOE4yo_rZcDkkT5zth

The dataset including 6 files 

X_train_WTFPAD.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the training data)

y_train_WTFPAD.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the training data)

X_valid_WTFPAD.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the validation data)

y_valid_WTFPAD.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the validation data)

X_test_WTFPAD.pkl : Packet's directions sequence (used as the testing data)

y_test_WTFPAD.pkl : Corresponding website's classes sequece (used as the testing data)

Before training and evaluating DF model please place these files into ../df/dataset/WTFPAD/

## Reproduce results
First of all, you will need to download the corresponding datase and place it in the 

  1. ../dataset/nodef/ directory for non-defended closed world 
  
  2. ../dataset/WTFPAD/ directory for WTF-PAD closed world
